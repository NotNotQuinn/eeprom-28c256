# EEPROM 28c256
This is a command-line utility for reading or writing to AT28C256 model
EEPROMs through an arduino with a breadboard.

This is made in an effort to follow along with [Ben Eater's 6502 computer building series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU&list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH),
but without buying the EEPROM programmer (because its expensive, and I have lots of free time).

## Features

This utility features uploading a binary file to the EEPROM, downloading the EEPROM
to a local file, and a hexdump like output.

### Upload

When uploading to the EEPROM the script writes the entire content of the EEPROM, and then
reads back the entire contents to verify they were written correctly. This cannot be disabled.

An example: Uploading `FILE.bin` to the eeprom.
```sh
$ ./28c256-rw.py -U FILE.bin
```

```txt
Writing... [0x7fc0] 100.00%
Verifying... [0x7fc0] 100.00%
```

### Download

When downloading the EEPROM contents, the EEPROM is read one page at a time (64 bytes).

An example: Downloading the EEPROM contents into `EEPROM-27-01-2023.bin`.
```sh
$ ./28c256-rw.py -D EEPROM-27-01-2023.bin
```

```
Reading... [0x7fc0] 100.00%
```

### Hexdump

To quickly check specific bytes in the EEPROM, hexdump spits them out in hexdump-like output.
The start/stop addresses can be any address. If there is repeated data, a "*" is shown.

An example: Dumping the entire EEPROM.

```
./28c256-rw.py -H
```

```

```

An example: Dumping bytes `0x2000` to `0x2060`.

```
./28c256-rw.py -H 0x2000:0x2060
```

```

```

An example: Showing bytes `0x7ffc` and `0x7ffd`.

```
./28c256-rw.py -H 0x7ffc:0x7ffe
```

```
7ffc                                       51 51                    |QQ|

```


## Setup

### Hardware required

If you need to use this, you will likely have most if not all of the hardware already:
* AT28C256 EEPROM
* Arduino with at least 28 free pins
* Breadboard
* 28+ wired ribbon cable (or equivalent; its just wires)

### Hardware setup

To setup the hardware:

1. Place the AT28C256 EEPROM into the breadboard.
2. Connect each pin of the AT28C256 EEPROM to the Arduino using the ribbon cable.
   Take note of the pin numbers on the Arduino which you used, connect 5V and GND also.
3. Connect the Arduino to your computer.

### Software setup

To setup the software:

1. Download and setup the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) on your computer.
	* Test that the arduino works properly by running a small test program to
	  flash the builtin LED.
2. Install the `camino` library to your Arduino IDE.
3. Download this repository from github onto your PC.
4. Create a new project in the arduino IDE and copy the `28c256.ino` file and `vec/` folder into it.
5. Edit the section labeled "EEPROM pins to Arduino pins" such that the arduino pins match
   which pin you used when plugging in the EEPROM. This step is very important
   to get right the first time.
6. Ensure you have `python3` installed on your system. Install the `camino` python package.
7. Run `28c256-rw.py` and see if it works!

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues setting up the EEPROM, there are a few things that might help you resolve your issues:

* Double check that the arduino pins used to plug in the EEPROM are correctly recorded in
  `28c256.ino`. If any of these are swapped it might not be obvious, but the data written
  will be wrong when read by some other hardware. However: It will seem correct ONLY from
  the arduino's perspective. Only if pins 14, 20, 22, 27 or 28 are swapped the chip won't
  work, otherwise it will seem to work, but not actually. View the
  [datasheet](https://eater.net/datasheets/28c256.pdf) to see what pin has which function.
  
* Try running the read/write tests. To access them, you have to remove the `#define USE_CAMINO`
  line near the beginning of `28c256.ino`. After uploading the file it will run a test to see
  if all the bytes written are read back properly by the arduino. This also works even if the
  connection using camino isn't working for some reason. There is a second copy of the same
  tests in `28c256-rw.py` that uses the camino connection. Try running both and compare.
  
* If the above tests are giving different data every time you run them, then you might have
  a problem with interference between the wires. To solve this issue I had to make sure none
  of the IO pin's wires were directly parallel to any address pin's wires. This is especially
  important for the lower order address bits. Try moving the wires while the arduino-based
  tests are running to get a sense of what positioning of wires can cause issues.
  
* If you are still having issues, try putting a 10 Î¼F (microfarad) capacitor across each power
  pin of the EEPROM (GND & VCC). This will store a tiny amount of power closer to the chip.
  This solved some of my issues, but doesn't seem to be necessary as after removing them the
  issues haven't come back. Only try this if you already have the capacitors.
  
* If you're still having issues and believe its a problem of this library/script feel free to 
  open an issue, and I'll try to resolve the issue as best I can when I have time. In your
  issue please be descriptive of what you have and have not tried, and what the results were.
  This will help me figure out what the issue might be quicker, as I will probably ask for this
  anyways.
